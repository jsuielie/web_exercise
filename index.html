                    In a study conducted in the United States, researchers say they found that the Epstein-Barr-Virus
                    (EBV)
                    was
                    definitely associated with all but one of 801 cases of multiple sclerosis.

                    The researchers analyzed blood samples from more than 10 million US military employees and
                    identified
                    801
                    people with multiple sclerosis. They then analyzed those blood samples — from the people with MS —
                    for
                    EBV
                    antibodies. That would indicate whether those people had ever had an EBV infection.

                    Epstein-Barr-Virus causes glandular fever, which commonly affects teenagers and young adults. It
                    causes
                    swollen glands and sore throat, and you usually only get it once in your life.
